 A method named save that takes as its receiver p, a pointer to Page
 It takes no parameters, and returns a value of type error
 It will save the Page's Body to a text file
 Title is used as the file name
 It returns an error value because that is the return type of WriteFile
 WriteFile is a standard library function that writes a byte slice to a file
 If anything go wrong while writing the file, an error value will be returned
 If all goes well, Page.save() will return nil (the zero-value for pointers, interfaces and some other values
 0600, passed as the third parameter to WriteFile, indicated that the file should be created with read-write
permissions for current user only (this is from UNIX)

 This function (or method) constructe the file name from the title parameter,
reads the file's contents into a new variable body, and returns a pointer
to a Page literal constructed with the proper title and body values
 Functions can return multiple values.
 io.ReadFile returns []byte and error
 In this version error is not handled yet; the "blank identifier" represented
by the underscore (_) symbol is used to throw away the error return value 
(in essence, assigning the value to nothing)
